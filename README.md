# Assignment 1

## Purpose

- This assignment will demonstrate your knowledge of creating a React Native application.
- It will assess how well you can navigate to different screens using the methods to create a tab navigation.
- You will be assessed on adding icons to your tabs

##Instructions

1. You must create a React Native / Expo application
2. Your application must have a tab navigation with three pages.
   - Home
   - Products
   - Contact
3. All pages must have content on the page. Example: images, text, headers, buttons, etc.
4. Style the pages using the styling shown in class
5. This must run in Expo and on an Android Emulator

# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
